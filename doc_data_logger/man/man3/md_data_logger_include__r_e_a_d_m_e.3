This directory is intended for project header files\&.
.PP
A header file is a file containing C declarations and macro definitions to be shared between several project source files\&. You request the use of a header file in your project source file (C, C++, etc) located in \fCsrc\fP folder by including it, with the C preprocessing directive `#include'\&.

Including a header file produces the same results as copying the header file into each source file that needs it\&. Such copying would be time-consuming and error-prone\&. With a header file, the related declarations appear in only one place\&. If they need to be changed, they can be changed in one place, and programs that include the header file will automatically use the new version when next recompiled\&. The header file eliminates the labor of finding and changing all the copies as well as the risk that a failure to find one copy will result in inconsistencies within a program\&.
.PP
In C, the usual convention is to give header files names that end with `\&.h'\&. It is most portable to use only letters, digits, dashes, and underscores in header file names, and at most one dot\&.
